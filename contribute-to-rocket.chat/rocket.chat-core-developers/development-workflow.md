# Development Workflow

To ensure a collaborative and efficient environment, there are key practices Rocket.Chat core developers should follow when contributing to the project. These practices not only benefit the team as a whole but also streamline the development process.

* **Step 1: Squad Task Selection**: The first step is to grab tasks from the squad board. These tasks might be pre-assigned by managers, product managers, or tech leads, or they can be self-selected.
* **Step 2: Clarify Task Requirements**: Before diving in, ensure you fully grasp the task's details. If anything seems unclear, don't hesitate to communicate with your manager or tech lead. They'll be happy to clarify or involve relevant parties in the discussion.
* **Step 3: Maintain a Detailed Task Log**: Use comments within the task to document decisions, steps taken, and any other relevant information. This meticulous record-keeping creates a clear history for future reference and assists other developers working on the same project.
* **Step 4: Update Task Status**: As you progress on the task, remember to update its status on the board. This could be "In Progress", "Waiting Review", "QA", or any other relevant stage. This keeps everyone informed about the task's workflow.
* **Step 5: Committing Changes**: Strive to write commit messages that clearly describe the change you made. Following a semantic commit style (like "fix: resolved image upload issue") improves code readability and future maintenance.
* **Step 6: Submitting a Pull Request**: After committing your changes, create a well-defined pull request (PR). The title should adhere to conventional commits standards (e.g., "fix: resolved image upload issue"). Provide a detailed description of the changes, their rationale, and any addressed issues. Include a [changeset](../modes-of-contribution/participate-in-rocket.chat-development/development-workflow#id-4.-adding-changeset-to-your-pull-request) for fixes or features, and update relevant documentation. Keep your PR focused on the original task. Avoid adding unrelated changes, even minor refactoring. If refactoring is necessary, create a separate PR.
* **Step 7: Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Whenever possible, include relevant tests (API, UI, or unit) within your PR to validate your code changes. This strengthens code quality and ensures functionalities work as intended. For fixes in particular, tests are crucial to prevent regressions and ensure the issue is truly resolved. Exceptions exist for purely visual changes or those dependent on external tools lacking reliable automated testing methods.
* **Step 8: Code Review**: The development team will meticulously examine your code. This review ensures it meets coding standards, functions as intended, and addresses any potential problems. We highly encourage active participation from everyone on the team in [code reviews](./code-review.md). Be prepared for discussions and revisions based on their feedback, fostering a collaborative environment.
* **Step 9: Review, Test, and Merge**: : After a thorough team review, your PR enters QA for rigorous testing. Upon successful QA, it lands in the merge queue for final integration.
