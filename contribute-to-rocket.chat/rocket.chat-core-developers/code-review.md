# Code Review

This process ensures your code adheres to established coding standards, functions as intended, and catches any potential problems you might have overlooked. The collaborative review fosters knowledge sharing within the team, leading to not only high-quality code but also improved development practices and a stronger overall codebase.

* **Step 1: Title and description**: Look for a clear and concise title and description in the PR. The title should accurately reflect the changes and follow the conventional commits standard, and the description should explain the purpose and functionality of the code.
* **Step 2: Verify Changeset (Fix/Feature PRs)**: For pull requests categorized as fixes or features, confirm that a changeset has been added. This changeset helps track versioning and simplifies release management.

* **Step 3: Verify Labels and Milestones**: Look for appropriate labels and milestones assigned to the PR. Labels help categorize the changes, while milestones track progress towards specific release versions. Confirm these are correctly assigned to ensure clear organization and efficient project management.
* **Step 4: Review Automated Checks**: Verify that all automated checks (linting, type checking, tests, etc.) have passed successfully. These checks help identify potential errors and ensure code quality is maintained.
* **Step 5: Code Review for Quality**:  Meticulously examine the code for adherence to project standards, architecture principles, security best practices, readability, and maintainability. Furthermore, ensure the PR focuses on a single solution. If the changes involve multiple solutions, suggest splitting them into separate PRs for a clearer and more manageable review process.
* **Step 6: Review Test Coverage**: Ensure the PR includes relevant tests that thoroughly cover the proposed solution. For exceptional cases (layout changes, external integrations, etc) where testing might be impractical, a comment explaining the rationale is recommended after seeking approval from the manager or tech lead. This fosters a balance between comprehensive testing and acknowledging limitations.
* **Step 7: Review, Test, and Merge**: : After a thorough team review, your PR enters QA for rigorous testing. Upon successful QA, a label must be added indicating completion. Once all changes have been addressed and necessary approvals are granted, the PR is automatically merged into the codebase by the designated bot.
