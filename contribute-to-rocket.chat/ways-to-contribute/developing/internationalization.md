# Internationalization

When developing in Rocket.Chat, you have the ability to add strings to our translation files which later will be translated to other languages by our community translators.

### Tools Used

For selecting strings for the correct language we use the [TAP:i18n](https://github.com/TAPevents/tap-i18n) meteor package.

For managing contributions from the translator's community we use [lingohub](https://lingohub.com/).

### Adding Strings to the Translation Files

To have a string translated you will firstly need a `key` that would be the identifier of the string you want to be translated, for example, the string `This room is read only` should have the key as `room_is_read_only`. Please have in mind when naming a key that spaces should be replaced with underscores (`_`) and it should be named in English, as is the language selected for Rocket.Chat's code. Finally, you will have the `key/value` pair will look like this: `"room_is_read_only": "This room is read only"`

You can also specify `placeholders`, that will allow you to change information on the string via parameters when calling the `i18n` method. A parameter will be surrounded by two double underscores (`__ __`), and it will look like this, `"Conversation_closed": "Conversation closed: __comment__."` where `__comment__` can be replaced by any string provided in the parameters.

After that, you will need to add this key to its respective `i18n.json` file under the [i18n](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/tree/develop/apps/meteor/packages/rocketchat-i18n/i18n) folder.

When your pull request is merged, our contributors at `LingoHub` will be notified of the new string and start translating it.

### Using Translated Strings on the code

Now that you have added your strings to the translation files, is time to use them in the code!

When writing on a `.js` file you can use the global method `TAPi18n.__()`. Now depending on where you are calling this method from, it can have different parameters. If you call it from the back-end of Rocket.Chat you will have to specify a language (which you can normally grab from a user's object). The method will look like this, `TAPi18n.__('YOUR_KEY_HERE', {}, user.language)`. You can also pass parameters on the second argument to replace placeholders on the translated strings. Now if you are calling from the front end you can simply use `TAPi18n.__('YOUR_KEY_HERE', {})` that will translate the selected string to the user's current selected language.

If the selected key is not present in the respective `.i18n.json` file it will default it to English, if no key is found it will display the key inserted in the method as a string.

Now if you are in a `.html` file, you can simply surround the string with `{{ "{{_ " }}}}` for example `{{ "{{_ YOUR_KEY_HERE" }}}}`. It will work the same as the method mentioned above, only with the convenience of adding it directly to the `.html` file.

Sometimes you can find some methods that require an object with a `i18nLabel` or `i18nDescription`. In these cases you only need to insert the key of the string, the method will do the rest.
