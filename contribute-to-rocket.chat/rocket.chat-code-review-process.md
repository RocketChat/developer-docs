# Rocket.Chat Code Review Process

Contributing to an open-source project like Rocket.Chat can be an exciting and fulfilling experience. However, it's crucial to understand the process that your contribution will undergo before it can be integrated into the main codebase. This guide aims to help you comprehend the stages involved in the Rocket.Chat code review process.

## Stage 1: Forking and Cloning

The first step in contributing to Rocket.Chat is to fork the project on GitHub and clone it to your local development environment. This allows you to work on your changes in a controlled environment without impacting the main project.

## Stage 2: Create a Branch

It's best to create a new branch for each new feature or bug fix. This helps to isolate your changes and makes it easier to track the work that has been done.

## Stage 3: Implementing Changes

This is the stage where you write your code. Make sure you follow Rocket.Chat's coding standards and guidelines ensure consistency and maintainability. Your code should be clean, well-commented, and tested thoroughly.

## Stage 4: Committing Changes

Once you've made your changes, you need to commit them. Each commit should be a single logical change, and the commit message should describe what the change does, why it's needed, and any potential implications it may have.

## Stage 5: Submitting a Pull Request

After you've committed your changes, it's time to submit a pull request (PR). The PR should be detailed and include a description of the changes, the reasons behind them, and any issues that they address. It should also include any necessary documentation changes.

Stage 6: Code Review

Now, the Rocket.Chat team will review your PR. This involves checking the code for any potential issues, ensuring it aligns with the project's coding standards and that it accomplishes what it is intended to do. This stage might involve some back-and-forth discussions, so be prepared to answer questions and possibly make revisions based on the feedback you receive.

## Stage 7: Acceptance or Rejection

Once the review process is complete, the team will decide whether to merge your PR into the main codebase or not. If your PR is accepted, it will be merged. If it's rejected, you'll be given feedback on why this decision was made.

It's important to remember that the decision to merge a PR is at the sole discretion of the Rocket.Chat team. As an open-source project, we value and respect each member of our community. However, contributing code doesn't guarantee that it will be merged.

Factors that influence this decision include but are not limited to, the code's quality, alignment with the project's goals, impact on the codebase's stability, and the resources required to support it.

We understand that putting time and effort into a contribution only for it to be rejected can be disheartening. However, the aim is always to ensure that the Rocket.Chat codebase remains high-quality, maintainable, and focused on meeting the needs of the project and its users.

We hope this guide gives you a clear picture of our code review process. We look forward to your contributions and to you being part of the Rocket.Chat community.
