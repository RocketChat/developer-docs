# Rocket.Chat Developer

Welcome to the developer documentation for Rocket.Chat.

With the help of unique applications, powerful plugins, and webhooks, Rocket.Chat enables you to expand and personalize your workspace. You can also integrate any custom apps you've developed on top of Rocket.Chat's webhooks to deliver data from external services into Rocket. Chat.

## Build and Integrate

Extend more with RocketChat using Apps, Webhooks, Live chat, and Rest APIs. As a developer, you can create your desktop and mobile Rocket.Chat app. You can also create an [app engine](broken-reference/) to enable users to operate more efficiently with their server, with the flexibility to integrate their workflows with preferred apps like Github and Jira, and less risk of data loss. You can also build your [Omnichannel](broken-reference/) apps.

## Extend and Customize

Extend Rocket.Chat's functionalities and customize the entire solution for your use case using [Bots](broken-reference/) and Rocket.Chat [API](reference/api/).
