# Mobile App White Labelling

You can rebrand Rocket.Chat Mobile Apps to suit your style guide. You can customize the App Icons, Splash Screens, App Name, and Colors for your mobile app.

## Requirements

To customize your mobile apps, here are some essential requirements:

* Intermediate knowledge of Android/iOS development and basic Javascript knowledge.
* The repo contains targets/build flavors to build our **experimental** and **official** apps. Both apps are equal but released at a different paces in the stores.
* The experimental folder contains the assets for the non-official app. If you see it, avoid worrying about breaking anything.

## Set up the GitHub Repository

* Ensure you have both iOS and Google developer accounts and the respective development environments working.
* Follow the [Getting Started with ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) guide.
* Clone the Rocket.Chat [ReactNative GitHub Repo](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative).&#x20;

`git clone -b single-server` [`https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative`](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative)
