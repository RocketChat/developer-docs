# Mobile App

The Rocket.Chat Mobile App is built using React Native, allowing us to develop Android and iOS applications from a single codebase. Setting up the development environment requires you to download and install multiple dependencies.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please maintain an active internet connection throughout the installation process.
{% endhint %}

## Requirements

Before setting up, confirm that these tools are installed and running correctly on your device:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Yarn](http://yarnpkg.com/) (recommended instead of npm)
* macOS with `XCode Command Line Tools` to run the iOS version,
* Android Studio to run the Android version.

{% hint style="info" %}
Follow the[ official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to set up your React Native environment. Navigate to the `React Native CLI Quickstart` section, as we don't support Expo-managed flow.
{% endhint %}

## Set up the codebase

* Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative) and install the dependencies by running these commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.ReactNative.git
cd Rocket.Chat.ReactNative
yarn
```

* Run the app

for _iOs_:

```
npx pod-install
yarn ios
```

or, for _android_:

```
yarn android
```

Now, the app is running on the simulator or your device.
