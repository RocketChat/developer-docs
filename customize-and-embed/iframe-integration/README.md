# Iframe Integration

An iframe (inline frame) is an HTML element that allows you to embed another web page within your own web page. This can be used to display content from other websites, such as a chat room, without having to leave your own website.

Rocket.Chat offers a multitude of customization and embedding options to seamlessly integrate its functionalities into your existing digital ecosystem. In Rocket.Chat, iframe integration allows you to embed a chat room from your Rocket.Chat workspace in an iframe on your own website. This can be a great way to provide your users with a seamless chat experience, without having to leave your website.&#x20;

Rocket.Chat's iframe integration goes beyond embedding â€“ it lets you seamlessly integrate Rocket.Chat into your app. You can authenticate users through your login page, eliminating the need for Rocket.Chat login. This ensures a smooth user journey, boosting satisfaction and engagement.

Some key features of Rocket.Chat iFrame includes the following:

1. [**Iframe User Authentication**](configuring-iframe-auth/)**:** To authenticate users via iframe integration, navigate to **Administration > Workspace > Settings > Accounts > Iframe**. Toggle on the **Enabled** option and proceed with [configuring the iframe auth](configuring-iframe-auth/). It allows you to set up user authentication through your own login page.
2. [**Embedding Rocket.Chat**](../embedded-layout.md)**:** Depending on your needs, you can embed Rocket.Chat in your application using an iframe. This provides a seamless integration of Rocket.Chat's features into your application's interface.
3. [**Event Listening**](iframe-events.md)**:** While embedding Rocket.Chat in your app, you can listen to events. To do this, navigate to **Administration > Settings > General > Iframe Integration.** You can enable [send (events) or receive (commands)](iframe-integration-sending-commands.md) depending on your needs. This feature allows your application to interact with Rocket.Chat, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.

By leveraging these features, you can significantly enhance the communication capabilities of your application, driving user engagement and satisfaction.
