# App Submission to the Marketplace

You have finished creating your first Rocket.Chat App, and successfully tested it locally. Now, you are ready to submit your App to the marketplace for users to explore.

The following step-by-step guide will take you through the whole process of application submission.

## Package the App

Before submitting your App, you need to package it. Currently, the Rocket.Chat Servers and Marketplace allow submission of zip files, these files can be created by running the command `rc-apps package` in your Apps' directory. This will package your App and create a zip file under the `dist` folder.

## App Submission through CLI

Submission through CLI sends the App in a `draft` state. The publisher must access the portal to be able to submit the App.

### Install a package

```
npm install -g @rocket.chat/apps-cli
```

### Develop Rocket.Chat App

#### Logging inside an app

Due to the limitations of NodeJS's `vm` package, we have had to implement a custom logger class. To make usage of this, you can use `this.getLogger()` and then do the normal `console` style logging.

#### `rc-apps create`

The development tools provide a command to quickly scaffold a new Rocket.Chat App, simply run `rc-apps create` and a new folder will be created inside the current working directory with a basic App that does nothing but will compile and be packaged in the `dist` folder.

#### App description

The app description file, named `app.json`, contains basic information about the app. You can check the [app-schema.json](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine/blob/master/src/definition/app-schema.json) file for all the detailed information and fields allowed in the app description file, the basic structure is similar to this:

```
{
    "id": "5cb9a329-0613-4d39-b20f-cc2cc9175df5",
    "name": "App Name",
    "nameSlug": "app-name",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "requiredApiVersion": "^1.4.0",
    "description": "App which provides something beneficial for Rocket.Chat users.",
    "author": {
        "name": "Author Name <author@email.com>",
        "support": "Support Url or Email"
    },
    "classFile": "main.ts",
    "iconFile": "beautiful-app-icon.jpg"
}
```

#### Extending the App class

The basic creation of an App is based on extending the `App` class from the Rocket.Chat Apps _definition_ library. Your class also has to implement the constructor and optionally the `initialize` function. For more details on those, check the App definition documentation.

```
import {
    IAppAccessors,
    IConfigurationExtend,
    IEnvironmentRead,
    ILogger,
} from '@rocket.chat/apps-engine/definition/accessors';
import { App } from '@rocket.chat/apps-engine/definition/App';
import { IAppInfo } from '@rocket.chat/apps-engine/definition/metadata';

export class TodoListApp extends App {
    constructor(info: IAppInfo, logger: ILogger, accessors: IAppAccessors) {
        super(info, logger, accessors);
    }

    public async initialize(configurationExtend: IConfigurationExtend, environmentRead: IEnvironmentRead): Promise<void> {
        await this.extendConfiguration(configurationExtend, environmentRead);
        this.getLogger().log('Hello world from my app');
    }
}
```

### Upload the App

For uploading the app, you need to add to the required parameters in the .rcappsconfig already created in the apps directory. It accepts two types of objects:-

1. Upload using username, password

```
{
    url: string;
    username: string;
    password: string;
}
```

2\. Upload using personal access token and userId

```
{
    url: string;
    userId: string;
    token: string;
}
```

### Enable autocomplete for commands

To enable autocomplete for the apps cli use the command `rc-apps autocomplete <your-shell-type>` with the shell type as zsh or bash as the supported types. This would provide a step- by-step instruction to enable shell completion in your preferred shell.
