# Content Guidelines

Before an app can be listed in the [Rocket.Chat Marketplace](https://www.rocket.chat/marketplace), it must undergo a thorough review process. This process includes a comprehensive investigation into the app's authenticity, accuracy, and technical proficiency. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that your app contains high-quality content, appropriate screenshots, and optional videos that accurately describe its functionality.

To successfully navigate the publishing process, adhering to a specific set of guidelines regarding app content is essential.&#x20;

### App Content Guidelines

The [Rocket.Chat Marketplace](https://www.rocket.chat/marketplace) offers a platform for your app to be featured alongside others, allowing users to easily search and filter through different categories of apps to find an app that caters to their business needs. This guide will provide you with information on how to make your app stand out in the Marketplace with the help of app content. To learn more about the visual guidelines for your app icon and images, please refer to our documentation on the [Graphics Guidelines](https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine/app-submission-to-the-marketplace/assets-guidelines).

#### App Name&#x20;

Choosing a well-thought-out name for your app is crucial in helping potential users understand its purpose and discover it in the Marketplace. Before finalizing a name, it is recommended to search the Marketplace for any existing apps with similar names. Keep the name as concise as possible, limiting it to two words.

* Keep it concise, straightforward, and distinctive
* Avoid lengthy and complex titles or abbreviations
* Avoid adding descriptive words to the app name
* Ensure that the app name is relevant and easy to remember

#### Categories&#x20;

Select from a curated list of app categories that are specific to your app. This will improve the searchability and refine the app filtering process. You can refer to the comprehensive list of supported app categories in our [Marketplace](https://www.rocket.chat/marketplace).

Avoid categorizing your app into too many categories, as it may dilute its value. If your app doesn't fit into any existing categories, reach out to us at marketplace@rocket.chat.

#### Supported Languages

List the languages that your app supports.

#### Author

The author's name and website link should be provided as the publisher details. If the publisher is an individual without a website, they can provide a link to their user profile page on GitHub.

#### Support

Support information, such as the support link or email address, should be included in this section. Users can be directed to the support desk portal if needed. If the publisher is an individual without a website or support email address, they can provide a link to the Issues page from the app repository on their GitHub account.

### App Description Page

The App Description Page is where potential users can get a detailed understanding of what your app can do. It's a crucial space that can influence their decision. To maximize its impact, make sure to showcase your app's features and use relevant visuals. Here are some sections you can leverage to accentuate your app capabilities.&#x20;

#### Short description  **Character Limit: 45 characters**

#### Long description

**Character Limit: 1000 characters (ideally 500 - 600)**

The long description should offer a concise overview of your app and its ability to address pain points. Its purpose is to convince users of the benefits of integrating with your app. To effectively resonate with your target audience, the integration should highlight its unique selling points. Use keywords that accurately describe your app's function and ensure the description effectively communicates its highlights. Approach the long description as a comprehensive FAQ, addressing any potential user queries about your app and its usage. Essentially, this section allows users to fully grasp the unique value your application brings to their workspace.&#x20;

When crafting the long description, make sure to:

* Highlight the most significant features and benefits of your app to ensure quick comprehension by users.
* Clearly articulate the specific problems your app addresses, enabling users to understand its potential use cases.
* Elaborate on the additional features and benefits, showcasing the versatility of your application through various use cases.

It is important to note that the description should be concise, as most users only read between 300 and 500 characters. It is advised to avoid using technical jargon and to refrain from generically discussing the app or product.
