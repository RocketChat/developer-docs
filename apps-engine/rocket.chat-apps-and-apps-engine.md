# Rocket.Chat Apps and Apps-Engine

## Rocket.Chat Apps-Engine

The Rocket.Chat Apps Engine provides a framework that enables users to create and host  Rocket.Chat Apps. It provides the APIs for Rocket.Chat Apps to interact with the host system. These apps allow for a tighter incoming/outgoing integration with Rocket.Chat&#x20;

## Rocket.Chat App

Rocket.Chat apps are extensions that users can add to their workspaces to customize and enhance their functionality. Apps can be integrated with third-party services.

The [Rocket.Chat Marketplace](https://www.rocket.chat/marketplace) provides a repository of apps users can browse, install and manage directly from within their workspace. You can also develop your own apps using the [Rocket.Chat Apps engine](https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine).

**These Apps can do the following :**

* Display interactive and dynamic content on their own surface - like a modal or the roomâ€™s contextual bar.
* Create buttons in the UI for users to interact with native content.
* Create slash commands for users to trigger more generic interactions.
* Register endpoints to receive data from other applications and services.
* Work on both desktop and mobile clients.
* Send messages to users; create and manage public channels, groups, discussions, and threads.

&#x20;Features the Engine allows Apps to use:

* Key-Value Storage System
* App-specific settings
